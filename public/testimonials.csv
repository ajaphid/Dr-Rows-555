Andrea McCoy Black,10/31/2022,"Dr. Row’s 555 breathing technique helped me through all of my pregnancies… It helped regulate my breathing, calm me down, and manage anxiety… I remember her warm tone saying, “Inhale for five, hold for five, release for five”… It’s helped with labor and tough moments… I have a busy mind, and it helps me center myself… Dr. Row’s 555 is highly recommended."
Jasmine Morris,4/10/2025,"Dr. Row’s 555 has helped me in so many ways… I was diagnosed with Postpartum depression… I started using Dr. Row’s 555 and entered therapy… It gave me the best medicine money can’t buy… I stopped taking medication… I’ve overcome so much with Dr. Row’s 555 and use it daily."
Claire Germello,4/29/2020,"[Dr. Row's 555] was first introduced to me during pregnancy as a way to relax. During my labor things became a little tense, [but with Dr. Row's guidance], I was able to relax and focus... Not only was it beneficial during labor, but also from every point forward, especially when dealing with my daughters and life in general. ...I love it because I can do it anywhere in any situation... I can take it anywhere with me."
