Andrea McCoy Black,"Dr. Row’s 555 breathing technique helped me through all of my pregnancies… It helped regulate my breathing, calm me down, and manage anxiety… I remember her warm tone saying, “Inhale for five, hold for five, release for five”… It’s helped with labor and tough moments… I have a busy mind, and it helps me center myself… Dr. Row’s 555 is highly recommended."
Jasmine Morris,"Dr. Row’s 555 has helped me in so many ways… I was diagnosed with Postpartum depression… I started using Dr. Row’s 555 and entered therapy… It gave me the best medicine money can’t buy… I stopped taking medication… I’ve overcome so much with Dr. Row’s 555 and use it daily."
